## Expected Impact
Very high.

## Exit Criteria

# Wait and Synchronization Reliability

## Rationale
Reliable async synchronization is foundational for agent success and should precede gesture expansion.

- Structured loading state detection
- Snapshot revision / staleness metadata
- Incremental / diff-based snapshot delivery (token-efficient)
- Focused snapshot scoping (subtree / target-based)
- Compose-aware wait robustness improvements
- Explicit interaction sequencing guidance (tap → wait → verify pattern)
- Exploration of optional action-level synchronization ergonomics (e.g. implicit stabilization or wait flags)

## Expected Impact
Very high.

## Exit Criteria
- wait_for_ui_change implemented
- Loading state detection available for representative controls
- Snapshot revision or staleness metadata exposed

# Verification Stabilization and Temporal Convergence

## Rationale
Real-world feedback exposed false-negative readiness failures caused by transient UI timing, even when target state had actually converged.

- encounter lag between UI convergence and verification success

## Scope

- Verify-until-stable semantics for readiness checks
- Stability confirmation windows
- Snapshot freshness and convergence heuristics

## Expected Impact
Very high.
