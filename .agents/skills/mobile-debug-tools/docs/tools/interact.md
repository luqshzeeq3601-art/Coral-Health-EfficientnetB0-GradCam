# Interact (UI actions, waits, and verification)

This document covers deterministic UI resolution, actions, waits, and outcome verification.

## Verification pattern

For mutation actions, the intended agent loop is:

**RESOLVE -> ACT -> WAIT (if needed) -> EXPECT**

Role split:

- `wait_for_*` = resolution and synchronization
- `expect_*` = final outcome verification

Important:

- `wait_for_*` tools must not be used as the final verification of action success when an applicable `expect_*` tool exists.
- action tools report execution success, not outcome correctness.
- `classify_action_outcome` should receive the runtime `action_type` when you want routing to distinguish local-state and side-effect actions.

## tap / swipe / type_text / press_back

These tools return a shared action execution envelope.

Example `tap` input:

```json
{ "platform": "android", "deviceId": "emulator-5554", "x": 100, "y": 200 }
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "action_id": "tap_1710000000000_1",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-23T08:00:00.000Z",
  "action_type": "tap",
  "lifecycle_state": "pending_verification",
  "source_module": "server",
  "target": { "selector": { "x": 100, "y": 200 }, "resolved": null },
  "success": true,
  "trace": {
    "action_id": "tap_element_1710000000002_3",
    "steps": [
      {
        "stage": "resolve",
        "timestamp": 1710000000002,
        "result": "success",
        "attempt_index": 0
      },
      {
        "stage": "execute",
        "timestamp": 1710000000003,
        "result": "success",
        "attempt_index": 1
      }
    ],
    "final_outcome": "success",
    "attempts": 1
  },
  "ui_fingerprint_before": "fp_before",
  "ui_fingerprint_after": "fp_after"
}
```

Guidance:

- `tap` is best for coordinate-based interactions when no resolved element is available.
- `swipe` is execution-only; use `wait_for_*` and `expect_*` to verify its effect when the expected outcome is known.
- `type_text` reports whether text entry was dispatched, not whether the intended field state is correct.
- `press_back` reports whether the back action was dispatched, not whether the intended destination screen was reached.

Preferred verification:

- navigation outcome known -> `expect_screen`
- local UI change known -> `expect_element_visible`
- readable element state known -> `expect_state`
- backend/API activity expected -> `classify_action_outcome` + optional `get_network_activity` if the UI signal remains ambiguous

Use `wait_for_screen_change` only when a visible transition is the expected outcome. If a button should trigger an API request but the screen should stay the same, rely on `action_type` plus classification first.
For backend-only actions, prefer comparing `get_screen_fingerprint` before/after and collect `get_network_activity` immediately after the action only if the result is still ambiguous; do not wait on `wait_for_screen_change` if no visible transition is expected.
Use `wait_for_ui_change` when the screen stays in place but visible text or element state should change.

---

## scroll_to_element

Scroll until an element matching the provided selector becomes visible, or until the tool reaches a stopping condition.

Input example:

```json
{ "platform": "android", "selector": { "text": "Offscreen Test Element" }, "direction": "down", "maxScrolls": 10, "scrollAmount": 0.7, "deviceId": "emulator-5554" }
```

Response example (found):

```json
{ "success": true, "reason": "element_found", "element": { "text": "Offscreen Test Element" }, "scrollsPerformed": 2 }
```

Response example (failure - unchanged UI):

```json
{ "success": false, "reason": "ui_unchanged_after_scroll", "scrollsPerformed": 3 }
```

Notes:

- Matching is exact on provided selector fields (`text`, `resourceId`, `contentDesc`, `className`).
- The tool fingerprints the visible UI between scrolls and can stop early if the UI does not change after a swipe.
- `scroll_to_element` can return success when it finds the element, but use `expect_element_visible` when you want explicit final verification of the expected visible result.

---

## wait_for_screen_change

Purpose:

- detect that a screen transition has occurred by waiting for the current fingerprint to differ from a previous fingerprint

Capabilities:

- synchronization when transition timing is uncertain
- detection that something changed on screen

Constraints:

- does not verify correctness of the resulting state
- must not be used alone to confirm action success when an applicable `expect_*` tool exists

Input example:

```json
{ "platform": "android", "previousFingerprint": "<hex-fingerprint>", "timeoutMs": 5000, "pollIntervalMs": 300, "deviceId": "emulator-5554" }
```

Success response example:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "previousFingerprint": "<old-hex-fingerprint>",
  "newFingerprint": "<hex-fingerprint>",
  "elapsedMs": 420,
  "observed_screen": { "fingerprint": "<hex-fingerprint>", "activity": "MainActivity" }
}
```

Failure (timeout) example:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "reason": "timeout",
  "previousFingerprint": "<old-hex-fingerprint>",
  "lastFingerprint": "<hex-fingerprint>",
  "elapsedMs": 5000,
  "observed_screen": { "fingerprint": "<hex-fingerprint>", "activity": "HomeActivity" }
}
```

Notes:

- Always compares to the original `previousFingerprint`.
- Treats `null` fingerprints as transient and keeps polling.
- Adds a stability confirmation before returning success to avoid transient animation frames.
- Follow with `expect_screen` when the expected destination is known.
- Do not use this as the main success check for backend/API activity that does not change the visible UI.

---

## wait_for_ui_change

Purpose:

- detect a stable in-place UI mutation without naming a target element first

Capabilities:

- waits for hierarchy, text, or state deltas
- uses snapshot revision metadata when available
- confirms the change remains stable before returning success
- defaults `stability_window_ms` to `300`

Mutation rules:

- synchronization-relevant: element addition or removal, visibility changes, enabled-state changes, navigation transitions, text or content-description changes, subtree structure mutation, semantic accessibility tree mutation
- not synchronization-relevant: animation frame updates, layout-only jitter, opacity-only visual transitions, non-semantic rendering updates

Guidance:

- prefer `wait_for_screen_change` for navigation
- prefer `wait_for_ui_change` for in-place updates and recomposition-style changes
- follow with `expect_*` when the expected final state is known

---

## adjust_control

Purpose:

- adjust a numeric control value with bounded verification

Notes:

- initial support is for slider-like controls that expose `value_range` or readable numeric value state
- `expect_state` is the verification surface used to read back the resulting value
- direct target placement is preferred; drag fallback is treated as degraded mode
- the tool returns `target_state`, `actual_state`, `within_tolerance`, `converged`, `attempts`, and `adjustment_mode`

Input example:

```json
{ "selector": { "text": "Duration" }, "property": "value", "targetValue": 30, "tolerance": 0.5, "platform": "android", "deviceId": "emulator-5554" }
```

---

## find_element

Locate a UI element on the current screen using semantic matching and return an actionable element descriptor.

Input:

```json
{ "query": "Login", "exact": false, "timeoutMs": 3000, "platform": "android", "deviceId": "emulator-5554" }
```

Output:

```json
{
  "found": true,
  "element": {
    "text": "Login",
    "resourceId": "com.example:id/login",
    "contentDesc": null,
    "class": "android.widget.Button",
    "bounds": { "left": 0, "top": 0, "right": 100, "bottom": 50 },
    "clickable": true,
    "enabled": true,
    "tapCoordinates": { "x": 50, "y": 25 },
    "telemetry": { "matchedIndex": 3, "matchedInteractable": true }
  },
  "score": 1.0,
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "resolution": {
    "confidence": 1.0,
    "reason": "exact_text_match",
    "fallback_available": false,
    "matched_count": 1,
    "alternates": []
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Best used when no precise selector is available yet.
- `tapCoordinates` are suitable for `tap` calls.
- `resolution` explains why the element was selected and may include fallback alternates when the runtime had to promote a parent or nearby control.
- Prefer `wait_for_ui` when you already know a deterministic selector and want a stable `elementId`.

---

## wait_for_ui

Purpose:

- resolve elements and/or detect that a UI availability condition has occurred

Capabilities:

- deterministic element resolution
- synchronization when element timing or availability is uncertain

Constraints:

- does not verify correctness of the resulting state
- must not be used alone to confirm action success when an applicable `expect_*` tool exists

Input:

```json
{
  "selector": { "text": "Generate Session", "contains": false },
  "condition": "clickable",
  "timeout_ms": 5000,
  "poll_interval_ms": 300,
  "match": { "index": 0 },
  "retry": { "max_attempts": 1, "backoff_ms": 0 },
  "platform": "android",
  "deviceId": "emulator-5554"
}
```

Success response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "matched": 1,
  "element": {
    "text": "Generate Session",
    "resource_id": null,
    "accessibility_id": null,
    "class": "android.widget.TextView",
    "bounds": [471, 1098, 809, 1158],
    "index": 8,
    "elementId": "el_..."
  },
  "metrics": { "latency_ms": 120, "poll_count": 1, "attempts": 1 },
  "requested": {
    "selector": { "text": "Generate Session", "contains": false },
    "condition": "clickable",
    "match": { "index": 0 }
  },
  "observed": {
    "matched_count": 1,
    "condition_satisfied": true,
    "selected_index": 8,
    "last_matched_element": {
      "text": "Generate Session",
      "resource_id": null,
      "accessibility_id": null,
      "class": "android.widget.TextView",
      "bounds": [471, 1098, 809, 1158],
      "index": 8,
      "elementId": "el_..."
    }
  }
}
```

Timeout response:

```json
{
  "status": "timeout",
  "error": { "code": "ELEMENT_NOT_FOUND", "message": "Condition visible not satisfied within timeout; observed 1 match(es)" },
  "metrics": { "latency_ms": 5000, "poll_count": 17, "attempts": 1 },
  "requested": {
    "selector": { "text": "Generate Session", "contains": false },
    "condition": "visible",
    "match": { "index": 0 }
  },
  "observed": {
    "matched_count": 1,
    "condition_satisfied": false,
    "selected_index": 8,
    "last_matched_element": {
      "text": "Generate Session",
      "resource_id": null,
      "accessibility_id": null,
      "class": "android.widget.TextView",
      "bounds": [471, 1098, 809, 1158],
      "index": 8,
      "elementId": "el_..."
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Use `wait_for_ui` to get a stable `elementId` for `tap_element`.
- Use it before an action when the target element or timing is uncertain.
- Use `requested` and `observed` to see exactly what condition was checked and what the last poll actually found.
- If the expected outcome is known after the action, follow with `expect_*`.

---

## tap_element

Tap a previously resolved UI element using its `elementId`.

Input:

```json
{ "elementId": "el_..." }
```

Success response:

```json
{
  "action_id": "tap_element_1710000000000_1",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-23T08:00:00.000Z",
  "action_type": "tap_element",
  "lifecycle_state": "pending_verification",
  "source_module": "interact",
  "target": {
    "selector": { "elementId": "el_123" },
    "resolved": {
      "elementId": "el_123",
      "text": "Play session",
      "resource_id": null,
      "accessibility_id": null,
      "class": "android.widget.TextView",
      "bounds": [519, 1770, 762, 1830],
      "index": 11
    }
  },
  "success": true,
  "ui_fingerprint_before": "fp_before",
  "ui_fingerprint_after": "fp_after"
}
```

Failure response:

```json
{
  "action_id": "tap_element_1710000000001_2",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-23T08:00:00.001Z",
  "action_type": "tap_element",
  "target": { "selector": { "elementId": "el_123" }, "resolved": null },

        "result": "failure",
        "attempt_index": 0
      },
      {
        "stage": "execute",

      {
        "stage": "recover",
        "timestamp": 1710000000005,
        "result": "retry",
        "attempt_index": 2
      }
    ],
    "final_outcome": "failure",
    "attempts": 1
  },
  "recovery": {
    "failure_class": "TargetResolutionFailure",

    "is_terminal": false,
    "retry_allowed": true
  },
  "ui_fingerprint_before": "fp_before",
  "ui_fingerprint_after": "fp_before"
}
```

Recommended usage:

1. resolve target with `wait_for_ui`
2. call `tap_element`
3. if needed, wait for transition with `wait_for_*`
4. verify with `expect_*`

Verification guidance:

- navigation -> `expect_screen`
- local UI change -> `expect_element_visible`

Failure handling:

- `STALE_REFERENCE` -> re-resolve the element, then retry
- `ELEMENT_NOT_INTERACTABLE` -> wait or refine the target, then retry
- `UNKNOWN` -> capture a snapshot and stop

---

## expect_screen

Deterministically verify that the intended navigation outcome of an action has occurred.

Input:

```json
{ "platform": "android", "deviceId": "emulator-5554", "fingerprint": "<expected-fingerprint>" }
```

or

```json
{ "platform": "android", "deviceId": "emulator-5554", "screen": "com.example.app.MainActivity" }
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "observed_screen": { "fingerprint": "<actual-fingerprint>", "screen": "com.example.app.MainActivity" },
  "expected_screen": { "fingerprint": "<expected-fingerprint>", "screen": null },
  "confidence": 1,
  "comparison": {
    "basis": "fingerprint",
    "matched": true,
    "reason": "observed fingerprint matches expected fingerprint <expected-fingerprint>"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Primary and authoritative verification tool for navigation outcomes.
- Prefer fingerprints; use semantic screen identifiers as a fallback.
- Works best when the expected screen identifier is known ahead of time.
- If transition timing is uncertain, place `wait_for_screen_change` before `expect_screen`.

---

## expect_element_visible

Deterministically verify that the intended UI outcome of an action has occurred by confirming a target element is visible.

Input:

```json
{
  "selector": { "text": "Play session" },
  "element_id": "optional-resolved-element-id",
  "timeout_ms": 5000,
  "poll_interval_ms": 300,
  "platform": "android",
  "deviceId": "emulator-5554"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "selector": { "text": "Play session" },
  "element_id": "el_123",
  "expected_condition": "visible",
  "element": {
    "elementId": "el_123",
    "text": "Play session",
    "resource_id": null,
    "accessibility_id": null,
    "class": "android.widget.TextView",
    "bounds": [519, 1770, 762, 1830],
    "index": 11
  },
  "observed": {
    "status": "success",
    "matched_count": 1,
    "condition_satisfied": true,
    "selected_index": 11
  },
  "reason": "selector is visible"
}
```

Notes:

- Primary and authoritative verification tool for expected element visibility.
- `selector` is the primary input; `element_id` is optional context only.
- The tool resolves the selector internally when needed.
- On failure, `reason` and `observed` tell you whether the selector was missing entirely or present but not yet visible.
- Use when the screen should remain on the same destination but a specific element should appear or become visible.

---

## expect_state

Deterministically verify a readable state property on a visible element.

Input:

```json
{
  "selector": { "text": "Notifications" },
  "property": "checked",
  "expected": true,
  "platform": "android",
  "deviceId": "emulator-5554"
}
```

Notes:

- Use this when the element is visible but its state also matters.
- Supported properties include `checked`, `selected`, `focused`, `expanded`, `enabled`, `text_value`, `value`, and `raw_value`.
- The tool compares normalized state and returns the observed value when available.

---

## classify_action_outcome + get_network_activity

Use this pair when the action may trigger network/backend work and the screen may not visibly change.

Pattern:

1. perform the action
2. call `classify_action_outcome` with `uiChanged` from `wait_for_screen_change` or a screen fingerprint comparison
3. pass the runtime `action_type` value as `actionType`
4. collect `get_network_activity` only if the action is side-effect oriented and the UI signal remains ambiguous
5. call `classify_action_outcome` again with `networkRequests` if you collected them

Guidance:

- `uiChanged=true` or `expectedElementVisible=true` means the action outcome is already verified
- local-state actions should prefer refreshed snapshots, `expect_state`, or `expect_element_visible` over default network inspection
- network activity is auxiliary evidence, not mandatory proof
